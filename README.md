# About-Me
My name is Gabriel and I currently work in the legal field.
I am hoping to break into the finance world and learn how to code to gain more valuable skills.
I chose FinTech as a career path because I love personal finance and technology, and I also want to learn to code so this felt like the best next step for me.
